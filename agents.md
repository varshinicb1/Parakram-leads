2. **Complete test coverage** — Unit tests for all services, integration tests for API endpoints
3. **Production observability** — Prometheus metrics, Grafana dashboards, structured JSON logging
4. **Frontend completion** — Messages page with conversation view, Settings with integration config
5. **LinkedIn integration** — Browser automation for message sending
6. **Celery Beat schedules** — Auto-analyze new leads every 6 hours, weekly pipeline reports

## Technical Debt to Address

| Issue | Risk | Fix |
|-------|------|-----|
| No test suite | Ship broken code | pytest + coverage > 80% |
| Brittle Google Maps selectors | Scraper breaks on DOM change | Abstract selectors, add fallbacks |
| No rate limiting | API abuse | Redis sliding window limiter |
| Prometheus not integrated | Blind to issues | Add middleware metrics |
| AuditLog not wired | Compliance gaps | Middleware decorator for all mutations |
| LinkedIn channel incomplete | Lost revenue opportunity | Official API or Playwright automation |
| No CI/CD pipeline | Manual deploys | GitHub Actions → Docker Hub → deploy |
| No backup strategy | Data loss risk | pg_dump cron + S3 upload |
| JWT 24h expiry, no refresh | Poor UX | Add refresh token rotation |
| CORS localhost only | Can't deploy frontend separately | Environment-based CORS origins |
