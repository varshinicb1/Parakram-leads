## 2. PRODUCT DEEP DIVES

### 2.1 Parakram Leads (Sigma Lead Intelligence)

**URL:** https://leads.getparakram.in
**Status:** LIVE — Generating revenue
**Stack:** FastAPI + Next.js 14 + PostgreSQL + Redis + Celery

#### What It Does
Autonomous B2B lead generation engine for Indian SMBs. Scrapes Google Maps, JustDial, and DuckDuckGo to find businesses with no digital presence. AI-analyzes their digital gaps (no website, no SSL, no mobile site), scores each lead (HOT/WARM/COLD), and generates personalized multi-channel outreach (WhatsApp, Email, LinkedIn).

#### Key Differentiators
- **13-point digital maturity scoring** — the most granular SMB digital audit available
- **Deficit-based opportunity scoring** — converts what's MISSING into project value
- **Self-hosted WhatsApp bridge** — no expensive Business API needed
- **Covers 60+ industries** with deterministic fallback templates

#### Code Map
```
backend/
├── app/api/v1/           → API routes (auth, leads, messages, scraper, intelligence, etc.)
├── app/services/         → Business logic (18 services)
├── app/models/           → SQLAlchemy models (6 models)
├── app/workers/          → Celery tasks (7 modules)
├── app/middleware/       → Logging, metrics, rate limit, audit
├── agents/               → Growth agent, Groq client, digital scorecard
├── alembic/versions/     → DB migrations (4)

frontend/
├── src/app/              → Next.js pages (10 routes)
├── src/components/       → React components (6)
└── src/lib/              → API client, pricing config
```

#### Pricing
- **Starter:** $3/mo — 250 leads, 50 AI credits
- **Growth:** $19/mo — 2,500 leads, 500 AI credits  
- **Business:** $99/mo — 15,000 leads, 3,000 AI credits
- **Enterprise:** Custom

#### AI Agent Instructions
When working on Leads:
1. All API routes live in `backend/app/api/v1/` — FastAPI with Pydantic schemas
2. Business logic lives in `backend/app/services/` — never in route handlers
3. All Celery tasks use `shared_task` from `backend/app/workers/celery_app.py`
4. Database models in `backend/app/models/` use SQLAlchemy 2.0 style
5. Frontend API client is in `frontend/src/lib/api.ts` — add new endpoints there
6. `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` defaults to `http://localhost:8000/api/v1`

---

### 2.2 Parakram VPS

**Status:** MVP Complete (v2.0.0)
**Domain:** *.getparakram.in (via Cloudflare Tunnel)
**Stack:** Python/customtkinter installer + PowerShell dashboard + Cloudflare Tunnel

#### What It Does
Turns any Windows laptop into a production-ready VPS with one click. Installs OpenSSH Server, Cloudflare Tunnel (public HTTPS URL), web-based management dashboard, and auto-start on boot. Supports subscription billing via Razorpay.

#### Current Backend Hosting Feature
The installer can optionally deploy the entire Parakram Leads backend (PostgreSQL, Redis, FastAPI, Celery, WhatsApp Bridge, Nginx) onto the Windows machine via Docker Compose. The frontend remains hosted on Cloudflare Pages. This makes the Windows laptop a self-hosted backend server for the Leads product.

- **Edge:** ₹599/mo (~$9) — 5 VPS, custom domain, auto-tunnel
- **Fleet:** ₹3,999/mo (~$49) — Unlimited VPS, API access, team management

#### AI Agent Instructions
When working on VPS:
1. `setup_engine.py` uses a checkpoint system — every step is idempotent and recoverable
2. New steps go in the `Checkpoint.STEPS` list AND the `run_all()` step list
3. Dashboard HTML is generated by `_generate_dashboard_html()` — edit as a raw string
4. Dashboard server is `_generate_server_script()` — PowerShell HttpListener
5. All user-facing strings should match the Apple-style black/white/gold aesthetic
6. `build.py` bundles `leads/` and `whatsapp-bridge/` as data for the EXE

### 2.5 Digital Presence Scorecard (Viral Lead Magnet)

**Status:** BUILDING — Core logic complete, UI pending
**Stack:** Python (HTML generation) + Groq LLM + CLI
**Code:** `backend/agents/digital_scorecard.py`

#### What It Does
An automated business audit tool that grades any business across 8 digital dimensions and produces an A+ to F grade report card. Each scorecard is a shareable HTML card (OG-ready for social media) with pre-written Twitter/LinkedIn posts.

#### The 8 Dimensions
| Dimension | Weight | What It Measures |
|-----------|--------|-----------------|
| Website | 20% | Has a website? Is it modern? Fast? |

| Analytics | 10% | Google Analytics? Tracking? |
| WhatsApp | 10% | WhatsApp button / chat? |
| Social Proof | 10% | Reviews? Testimonials? Social media? |

#### Viral Mechanism
- **Grade A/B** → Business owner shares proudly → competitors see it → they want one too
- **Grade D/F** → Business owner contacts Parakram to fix it
- **Every scorecard** includes a pre-written social media post → organic distribution

#### Usage
```bash
python run_growth_agent.py --scorecard "Cafe Coffee Day" --website "https://cafecoffeeday.com"
```

#### Monetization
- **Free:** Basic scorecard (PDF download)
- **Pro:** ₹99 — Branded, shareable HTML card + social media kit + competitor comparison
- **Agency:** ₹999 — Bulk scorecards (100+) + white-label branding

#### AI Agent Instructions
1. Scorecard lives in `backend/agents/digital_scorecard.py` — HTML generation uses string templates
2. Shareable cards are self-contained HTML (no external deps) for OG preview
3. Pre-written posts target Twitter + LinkedIn with relevant hashtags
4. CLI integration is in `backend/run_growth_agent.py`

---

### 2.8 Parakram Edge Network (Marketplace)

**Status:** Ideation / Whitepaper Phase

#### What It Does
A global decentralized compute network where:
- **Node Operators** (anyone with a laptop) install Parakram VPS → earn money hosting workloads
- **Tenants** (developers, startups) get compute at 5–10x cheaper than AWS/DO
- **Parakram** takes a 15–20% platform fee

#### Economics
| Metric | Traditional Cloud | Parakram Edge Network |
|--------|------------------|----------------------|
| 1 vCPU / 1GB RAM | $12/mo (DigitalOcean) | $0.50–$1/mo |
| 4 vCPU / 8GB RAM | $48/mo | $3–$6/mo |
| Setup time | 5 minutes | Instant (pre-installed) |
| Location | Fixed region | Anywhere node exists |

#### Trust & Security Model
- **Sandboxed workloads** — Docker containers with strict CPU/memory limits
- **No cross-container networking** — complete isolation
- **Encrypted in transit** — WireGuard or Cloudflare Tunnel
- **Host blind** — operator never sees tenant data (encrypted at rest)
- **Reputation system** — nodes with high uptime get priority workloads
- **Escrow payments** — release to operator only after workload health confirmed

#### Go-To-Market
1. **Parakram VPS** → node operators install for their own use (existing product)
2. **Deploy-Leads** → first paid workload (proof tenant demand exists)
3. **Open registry** → node operators opt into marketplace
4. **API launch** → tenants deploy containers via API
5. **Scale** → mobile nodes (Edge), Raspberry Pi, repurposed hardware

---

### 2.9 WhatsApp Bridge

**Status:** DEPLOYED (internal)
**Stack:** Node.js + Express + TypeScript + Baileys
**Code:** `whatsapp-bridge/`
**Docker:** `whatsapp-bridge/Dockerfile` → runs on node:22-alpine

#### What It Does
A self-hosted WhatsApp Web connection bridge that exposes an Express API on port 4000. Uses `@whiskeysockets/baileys` to implement the WhatsApp multi-device protocol — no expensive Business API required. Supports QR-code device pairing, message sending/receiving, and media handling.

#### Architecture
```
whatsapp-bridge/
├── src/
│   ├── index.ts          → Express server, routes, middleware
│   ├── whatsapp.ts       → Baileys client, auth, message handlers
│   └── types.ts          → TypeScript type definitions
├── Dockerfile            → Multi-stage build (node:22-alpine)
├── package.json          → Express, Baileys, TypeScript
└── tsconfig.json         → TypeScript config
```

#### Why It Matters
- **Cost:** WhatsApp Business API charges per conversation. Baileys is free.
- **Control:** Full access to message data, no third-party dependency.
- **Scalability:** Multiple sessions, one bridge. Can handle 100+ WhatsApp accounts.

#### Monetization
- Included with Parakram Leads (Growth+ plans)

2. **Plan** — write todo list, identify all files that need changes
3. **Implement** — one file at a time, verify each compiles
4. **Verify** — run tests, typecheck, lint
5. **Document** — update VISION.md if product page needs updating

### 4.2 Bug Fix Workflow

1. Reproduce the bug (identify exact error / unexpected behavior)
2. Find root cause (grep for relevant code, trace the call chain)
3. Write a failing test (if applicable)
4. Fix the bug
5. Run the test suite
6. Check for regressions in related code

### 4.3 Deployment Workflow

1. Push to `main` → CI builds and tests automatically
2. `deploy.yml` builds Docker images → ghcr.io
3. Brand site deploys to Cloudflare Pages (`getparakram.in`)
4. VPS deploy (if `VPS_ENABLED=true`) → SSH + docker compose pull && up -d

### 4.4 Backend Testing

```bash
cd backend
pytest -v --tb=short --ignore=tests/test_intelligence_api.py
```

Tests use:
- `with override_get_db` context manager for DB isolation

## 5. AI EMPLOYEE ONBOARDING

Welcome to Parakram. Here is everything you need to know.

### 5.1 Your Role

You are an AI agent assigned to one of the teams in section 1.2. Your work must be:

1. **Idempotent** — safe to run multiple times
2. **Recoverable** — never leave partial state on failure
3. **Observable** — log everything, audit all mutations
