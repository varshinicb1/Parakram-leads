   git clone git@github.com:bluewave-labs/capture
   cd capture
   just build   # or: go build -o dist/capture ./cmd/capture/
   ```

### Linux Systemd Service

An install script is provided at [`deployment/linux/install.sh`](./deployment/linux/install.sh). It automatically detects your CPU architecture, downloads the latest release from GitHub, installs the binary to `/usr/local/bin`, and registers a systemd service.

**Requirements:** `curl`, `tar`, and a system running systemd. Must be run as root.

1. Download and run in one step:

    ```shell
    curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bluewave-labs/capture/main/deployment/linux/install.sh | sudo bash
    ```

    The script will prompt you for `API_SECRET` if it is not supplied as an argument.

2. Supply options inline if preferred:

    ```shell
    curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bluewave-labs/capture/main/deployment/linux/install.sh \
        | sudo bash -s -- --api-secret "your-secret-key"
    ```

3. All available options:

    ```shell
    curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bluewave-labs/capture/main/deployment/linux/install.sh \
        | sudo bash -s -- \
            --api-secret "your-secret-key" \
            --port 59232 \
            --install-dir /usr/local/bin \
            --service-name capture
    ```

    Or download the script first and run it locally:

    ```shell
    curl -fsSL -o install.sh https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bluewave-labs/capture/main/deployment/linux/install.sh
    sudo bash install.sh --api-secret "your-secret-key"
    ```

3. Reload, enable, and start the service:

    ```shell
    systemctl daemon-reload
    systemctl enable capture
    systemctl start capture
    ```

4. Verify the service is running:

    ```shell
    systemctl status capture
    ```

### macOS Launchd Service

An install script is provided at [`deployment/macos/install.sh`](./deployment/macos/install.sh). It automatically detects your CPU architecture, downloads the latest release from GitHub, installs the binary to `/usr/local/bin`, and registers a system-wide launchd daemon.

**Requirements:** `curl`, `tar`, macOS, and root access via `sudo`.

1. Download and run in one step:

    ```shell
    curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bluewave-labs/capture/main/deployment/macos/install.sh | sudo bash
    ```

    The script will prompt you for `API_SECRET` if it is not supplied as an argument.

2. Supply options inline if preferred:

    ```shell
    curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bluewave-labs/capture/main/deployment/macos/install.sh \
        | sudo bash -s -- --api-secret "your-secret-key"
    ```

3. All available options:

    ```shell
    curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bluewave-labs/capture/main/deployment/macos/install.sh \

            --api-secret "your-secret-key" \
            --port 59232 \
            --install-dir /usr/local/bin \
            --service-name com.bluewavelabs.capture
    ```

    Or download the script first and run it locally:

    ```shell
    curl -fsSL -o install.sh https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bluewave-labs/capture/main/deployment/macos/install.sh
    sudo bash install.sh --api-secret "your-secret-key"
    ```

4. Full option reference:

    | Option           | Description                              | Default                      |
    | ---------------- | ---------------------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
    | `--api-secret`   | Authentication key (required)            | *(prompted)*                 |
    | `--port`         | Port the agent listens on                | `59232`                      |
    | `--install-dir`  | Directory to install the binary          | `/usr/local/bin`             |
    | `--service-name` | launchd label and plist filename         | `com.bluewavelabs.capture`   |

5. After installation, manage the service with `launchctl`:

    ```shell
    sudo launchctl load /Library/LaunchDaemons/com.bluewavelabs.capture.plist
    sudo launchctl start com.bluewavelabs.capture
    sudo launchctl list | grep com.bluewavelabs.capture
    tail -f /var/log/com.bluewavelabs.capture.log
    ```

<!-- markdownlint-disable MD024 -->
#### Manual setup

If you prefer to configure the service manually, a template plist is provided at [`deployment/macos/capture.plist`](./deployment/macos/capture.plist).

1. Edit the plist with your binary path, working directory, secret key, and any other settings you need:

    ```shell
    nano deployment/macos/capture.plist
    ```

2. Copy it to the launchd daemon directory and set the required permissions:

    ```shell
    cp deployment/macos/capture.plist /Library/LaunchDaemons/com.bluewavelabs.capture.plist
    chown root:wheel /Library/LaunchDaemons/com.bluewavelabs.capture.plist
    chmod 644 /Library/LaunchDaemons/com.bluewavelabs.capture.plist
    ```

3. Load and start the service:

    ```shell
    sudo launchctl load /Library/LaunchDaemons/com.bluewavelabs.capture.plist
    sudo launchctl start com.bluewavelabs.capture
    ```

4. Verify the service is running:

    ```shell
    sudo launchctl list | grep com.bluewavelabs.capture
    ```

### Windows Service

A PowerShell install script is provided at [`deployment/windows/install.ps1`](./deployment/windows/install.ps1). It automatically detects your CPU architecture, downloads the latest release from GitHub, installs the binary, and registers a Windows service.

**Requirements:** PowerShell 5.1+ and an Administrator terminal.

1. Open PowerShell **as Administrator** and run in one step:

    ```powershell
    Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope Process -ExecutionPolicy Bypass
    Invoke-RestMethod https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bluewave-labs/capture/main/deployment/windows/install.ps1 | Invoke-Expression
    ```

    The script will prompt you for `API_SECRET` if it is not supplied as a parameter.

2. Supply parameters inline if preferred:

    ```powershell
    & ([scriptblock]::Create(
        (Invoke-RestMethod https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bluewave-labs/capture/main/deployment/windows/install.ps1)
    )) -APISecret "your-secret-key"
    ```

3. All available parameters:

    ```powershell
    & ([scriptblock]::Create(
        (Invoke-RestMethod https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bluewave-labs/capture/main/deployment/windows/install.ps1)
    )) -APISecret "your-secret-key" -Port 59232 -InstallDir "C:\Program Files\Capture" -ServiceName "capture"
    ```

    Or download the script first and run it locally:

    ```powershell
    Invoke-RestMethod https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bluewave-labs/capture/main/deployment/windows/install.ps1 -OutFile install.ps1
    Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope Process -ExecutionPolicy Bypass
    .\install.ps1 -APISecret "your-secret-key"
    ```

4. Full parameter reference:

    | Parameter      | Description                              | Default                      |
    | -------------- | ---------------------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
    | `-APISecret`   | Authentication key (required)            | *(prompted)*                 |
    | `-Port`        | Port the agent listens on                | `59232`                      |
    | `-InstallDir`  | Directory to install the binary          | `C:\Program Files\Capture`   |
    | `-ServiceName` | Windows service name                     | `capture`                    |

5. After installation, manage the service with standard PowerShell cmdlets:

    ```powershell
    Get-Service capture
    Stop-Service capture
    Start-Service capture
    Restart-Service capture
    ```

### Reverse Proxy and SSL

You can use a reverse proxy in front of the Capture service to handle HTTPS requests and SSL termination.

#### Caddy

```lua
├deployment/reverse-proxy-compose/
├── caddy/
│   └── Caddyfile
└── caddy.compose.yml
```

1. Go to the `deployment/reverse-proxy-compose` directory

    ```shell
    cd deployment/reverse-proxy-compose
    ```

2. Replace `replacewithyourdomain.com` with your actual domain in [deployment/reverse-proxy-compose/caddy/Caddyfile](./deployment/reverse-proxy-compose/caddy/Caddyfile)
3. Set `API_SECRET` environment variable for the Capture service in [deployment/reverse-proxy-compose/caddy.compose.yml](./deployment/reverse-proxy-compose/caddy.compose.yml).
4. Ensure your domain’s DNS A/AAAA records point to this server’s IP.
5. Open inbound TCP ports 80 and 443 on your firewall/security group.

Start the Caddy reverse proxy

```shell
docker compose -f caddy.compose.yml up -d
```

## Endpoints

- **Base URL**: `http://<host>:<PORT>` (default port `59232`)
- **Authentication**: Every `/api/v1/**` route requires `Authorization: Bearer $API_SECRET`. `/health` stays public so you can use it for liveness checks.

| `GET`  | `/api/v1/metrics/disk`   | ✅   | Disk capacity, inode usage, and IO stats.                                                           |                                                |
| `GET`  | `/api/v1/metrics/host`   | ✅   | Host metadata (OS, uptime, kernel, etc.).                                                           |                                                |
| `GET`  | `/api/v1/metrics/smart`  | ✅   | S.M.A.R.T. drive health information.                                                                |                                                |

All responses share the same envelope:

```jsonc
{
  "data": {
    // collector-specific payload
  },
  "capture": {
    "version": "1.0.0",
    "mode": "release"
  },
  "errors": [
    // optional array of error messages if any collectors failed, can be null
  ],
}
```

Collectors can partially fail; when that happens the API responds with HTTP `207 Multi-Status` and fills `errors` with detailed reasons so you can alert without dropping other metric data.
