"""
Smart Sequence Engine — autonomous multi-channel outreach sequences that adapt in real-time.

Trick nobody else does:
- Sequences auto-adjust based on lead engagement
- Channel switching mid-sequence if one channel isn't working
- Time-aware delivery (sends at optimal local time)
- Frequency capping to avoid burnout
- A/B testing built-in at sequence level
