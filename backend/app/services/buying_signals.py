"""
Buying Signal Monitor — continuously monitors external signals to detect
when leads are ready to buy. The trick: we don't need real-time scraping;
we detect signals through patterns already available in our data.

Signal categories:
1. Digital decay — website goes down, SSL expires, features break
2. Review activity — new reviews indicate active business
3. Competitor moves — competitor website changes indicate market shift
4. Business events — detected through review patterns, opening hours changes
5. Hiring signals — job posting keywords on website
